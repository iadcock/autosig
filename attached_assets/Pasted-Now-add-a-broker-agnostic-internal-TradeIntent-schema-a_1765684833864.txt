Now add a broker-agnostic internal TradeIntent schema and execution routing.

Locked architecture:
- Brokers do NOT handle historical trading; paper + historical must be internal.
- Therefore ALL parsed signals must become a TradeIntent first, then be routed to:
  - TradierExecutor for LIVE
  - PaperExecutor for PAPER
  - HistoricalExecutor for HISTORICAL (stub only)

Implement:

1) Create models.py (or trade_intent.py) with Pydantic models or dataclasses:

TradeIntent:
- id (uuid)
- created_at (iso timestamp)
- execution_mode: "live" | "paper" | "historical"
- instrument_type: "stock" | "option" | "index_option"
- underlying: str
- symbol: str | None   (for stock, symbol==underlying; for options, optional)
- action: "open" | "close"
- order_type: "market" | "limit"
- limit_price: float | None
- limit_min: float | None
- limit_max: float | None
- quantity: int
- risk_pct: float | None
- legs: list[OptionLeg]  (empty for stock; length 1 for single-leg options in v1; later can be 2+)

OptionLeg:
- side: "BUY" | "SELL"
- option_type: "CALL" | "PUT"
- expiration: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- strike: float
- quantity: int

2) Create executors:
- executors/tradier_executor.py
  - execute(trade_intent: TradeIntent) -> ExecutionResult
  - Map TradeIntent to Tradier API calls using tradier_client.py
  - For now: support stock orders and single-leg SPX options orders

- executors/paper_executor.py
  - execute(trade_intent) -> ExecutionResult (STUB)
  - Return a simulated fill result with placeholders (no pricing engine yet)
  - Log that this is simulated

- executors/historical_executor.py
  - execute(trade_intent) -> ExecutionResult (STUB)
  - Return a mock result and log that historical replay is not implemented yet

ExecutionResult model:
- status: "filled" | "submitted" | "rejected" | "simulated"
- broker: "tradier" | "paper" | "historical"
- order_id: str | None
- message: str
- submitted_payload: dict | None

3) Create router:
- execution/router.py
  - execute_trade(trade_intent) routes to the correct executor by execution_mode

4) Add a tiny demo script: trade_intent_demo.py
- Create one TradeIntent for a stock (SPY buy 1 market)
- Create one TradeIntent for an SPX single-leg option (1 contract)
- Run each in PAPER mode (should simulate)
- Run in LIVE mode only if LIVE_TRADING=true env var, otherwise log and skip.

Do not change any Whop scraping/parsing yet in this prompt. This is only internal schema + execution plumbing.
