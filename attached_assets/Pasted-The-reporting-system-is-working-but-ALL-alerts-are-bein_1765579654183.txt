The reporting system is working, but ALL alerts are being classified as NON_SIGNAL.
This is incorrect. Real trade alerts (e.g. GLD LEAP debit spreads) are being rejected.

Fix the signal classification logic as follows:

1) Update the parser so an alert is classified as SIGNAL if ALL of these are present
   anywhere in the text (multi-line allowed):
   - A ticker symbol (1–5 capital letters, common ETF/stock symbols)
   - An expiration date (MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, or textual like "6/17/2027 exp")
   - At least one option leg:
       examples:
         "+1 415 C"
         "-1 420 C"
         "Sell to open the 15 put"
   - A limit price:
       examples:
         "Limit 1.85-1.9 debit"
         "Limit .15 credit to open"
   - A size indicator:
       examples:
         "2% size"
         "1% size"
         "$1500 in buying power"

2) Strategy names like "bullish call debit spread" should be OPTIONAL.
   Do not reject alerts just because the strategy string does not match a hardcoded list.

3) Allow LEAPS and long-dated expirations.
   Do NOT reject based on expiration being far in the future.

4) If all required components are present:
   - classification = "SIGNAL"
   - parsed_signal should include:
       ticker
       expiration
       legs (list)
       limit_min / limit_max
       debit_or_credit
       size_pct (or size_bp)
       raw_text

5) If the alert is an EXIT (e.g. "take profits", "cut", "close"):
   - classification = "SIGNAL"
   - action_hint = "EXIT"
   - Do NOT classify exits as NON_SIGNAL.

6) Update non-signal reasons so commentary, assignments, and coaching posts
   are still marked NON_SIGNAL with a clear reason.

7) Re-run the parser logic against recent alerts so that
   a GLD LEAP call debit spread like:

   "GLD leap bullish call debit spread
    6/17/2027 exp
    +1 415 C / -1 420 C
    Limit 1.85-1.9 debit to open
    2% size"

   is classified as SIGNAL and produces an execution plan.

Do NOT change logging or report generation — only fix parsing and classification.
