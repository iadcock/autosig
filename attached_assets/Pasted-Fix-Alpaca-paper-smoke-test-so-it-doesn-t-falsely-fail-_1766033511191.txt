Fix Alpaca paper smoke test so it doesn't falsely fail due to fill/position timing or existing baseline positions.

Current behavior:
- BUY order accepted but position confirmation fails
- SELL step says "No position to sell" even when baseline qty exists
- Overall test marked FAILED incorrectly

Required changes (alpaca_smoke_test):

1) Baseline handling:
- Before placing BUY, fetch current AAPL position qty (baseline_qty). If position doesn't exist, baseline_qty = 0.
- Store baseline_qty in the test state.

2) BUY step:
- Place BUY 1 AAPL market (as now).
- Record order_id.

3) Poll order status (preferred) with retry/backoff:
- Add a new step: "Check BUY Order Status"
- Poll GET /v2/orders/{order_id} up to 8 times with 2s sleep (max ~16s).
- If status becomes "filled" or "partially_filled", mark ok=true and record filled_qty/filled_avg_price if present.
- If still "accepted/new" after retries, mark step as SKIPPED_PAPER (not failed) with summary "Order accepted but not filled yet".

4) Confirm position step:
- Fetch AAPL position qty (current_qty).
- Compute delta = current_qty - baseline_qty.
- If delta >= 1 => ok=true ("Position increased by delta").
- If delta == 0 and order not confirmed filled => mark as SKIPPED_PAPER ("Position not updated yet in paper").
- Do NOT mark the whole test failed for this.

5) SELL step (safe liquidation rule):
- Only attempt SELL if delta > 0 (i.e., only sell shares that were added during this test).
- If delta == 0 => SKIPPED_PAPER with reason "No new shares confirmed from this test; will not sell baseline holdings".

6) Confirm close:
- If SELL attempted, poll order status similarly and then confirm current_qty returned to baseline_qty.
- If not attempted, SKIPPED_PAPER.

7) Overall success logic for Alpaca paper:
REQUIRED steps:
- Get Account
- Get Clock
- Get Asset
- BUY accepted (HTTP 200 + order id)
- List Orders
OPTIONAL / PAPER-LIMITED:
- Order filled
- Position delta
- Sell close flow
If required steps pass, overall success=true even if optional steps are skipped.

8) UI rendering:
- Treat SKIPPED_PAPER like warning (⚠️) not failure (❌)

Do NOT sell baseline shares. Do NOT weaken live trading logic (this is paper smoke test behavior).
