Refactor the UI to reduce clutter by introducing a tabbed navigation layout with separate pages:
Dashboard, Review Queue, Brokers, Settings, Logs.

Current issue:
- Too many controls/buttons on the front page.
Goal:
- Make the app feel organized and production-like without React.
- Use Flask templates (Jinja) + small vanilla JS for interactivity.

REQUIREMENTS

1) Create a base layout template:
- templates/base.html
Include:
- Top nav bar with tabs:
  Dashboard (/)
  Review Queue (/review-ui)
  Brokers (/brokers)
  Settings (/settings)
  Logs (/logs)
- Simple clean styling (CSS) and consistent spacing.
- Highlight active tab.

2) Move content into separate pages:

A) Dashboard (/)
Keep only:
- Market window status (within window / outside) and start/end times
- Auto Mode status (enabled/disabled) + toggle button
- Last action summary (executed/skip + reason)
- Trades today/hour counters
OPTIONAL: keep ONE small button group “Quick Checks” that links to Brokers page.
Remove the large tables from here.

B) Review Queue (/review-ui)
Move the Review Queue table + approve/reject workflow here.
Keep all existing functionality:
- list signals
- show detail panel
- approve paper / approve live (live should remain gated)
- reject with notes
Use the existing JSON endpoints; the page can fetch and render.

C) Brokers (/brokers)
Move ALL broker-related utilities here:
- Alpaca Health Check button + results table
- Tradier Health Check button + results table
- Paper Mirror status display (enabled/disabled)
- Optional: a “Run PAPER execution test” section later (not required)
Do NOT place trades from health checks.

D) Settings (/settings)
Create a settings UI with:
- Toggle switches and inputs for:
  PAPER_MIRROR_ENABLED (toggle)
  AUTO_POLL_SECONDS (number)
  AUTO_WINDOW_BUFFER_MINUTES (number)
  MAX_RISK_PCT_PER_TRADE (number)
  MAX_DAILY_RISK_PCT (number)
  MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS (number)
  ALLOW_0DTE_SPX (toggle)
- A “Save Settings” button that POSTs to a settings endpoint.
- A “Reset to Defaults” button.

Back-end:
- Create settings_store.py that persists settings to data/settings.json
- Load settings on startup, fallback to env defaults if file missing.
- Update existing logic to read from settings_store first, env second.

Endpoints:
- GET /api/settings -> returns current settings JSON
- POST /api/settings -> updates settings and persists
- POST /config/paper_mirror may remain but should be wired to settings page too
(Ensure one source of truth: settings_store.)

E) Logs (/logs)
Create a simple log viewer:
- Show last 50 lines from logs/execution_plan.jsonl (reverse chronological)
- Add a “Download Backup ZIP” button (if already implemented, move it here)
- Add filter dropdown: All / Executed / Skipped (optional if quick)

3) Keep button animations:
- For health check buttons and approve buttons: running spinner → success/fail
- Use shared JS helper functions in static/app.js

4) Code organization:
- Add static/styles.css for consistent styling
- Add static/app.js for shared fetch+render helpers
- Ensure templates are clean and minimal.

5) Do NOT break existing endpoints.
- Keep current JSON endpoints used by auto mode/review queue/health checks.
- Only move the UI around and add settings persistence.

ACCEPTANCE
- Home page is clean and not crowded.
- Review queue has its own page and works.
- Brokers page shows both health checks clearly.
- Settings page saves toggles/values and affects app behavior.
- Logs page shows execution history and backup download.
